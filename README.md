# dictionary_of_numerals

A program that takes a number from a command-line argument and convert it to a symbolic language.

**Executable file name:** numbers_dict

**The source code is compiled as follows:**

```
$>make
Making Numbers_dict2...
numbers_dict
```
The makefile also contains the rules `clean` - delete object files, `fclean` - delete everything executable file, including , and `re` - delete everything, including executable file and compile again.

The program can receive up to 2 command line argumentsï¼š

- If the number of command line arguments is one `./numbers_dict 178920000`, then the argument is a converted number.

- If there are 2 command line arguments `./numbers_dict numbers.dict 178920000`, the 1st argument is the name of the new dictionary, the 2nd argument is the value that needs to be converted.

The program uses a dictionary (numbers.dict) as a project resource.

You can connect any other dictionaries written using the numbers.edit template:

```
[a number][0 to n spaces]:[0 to n spaces][any printable characters]\n
```

for example:
```
18: dix-huit\n
```

**each line in the dictionary must necessarily end with `\n`**

This project was created during the [school 42](https://www.42.fr) training program and helps to delve into the problem of storing numeric values exceeding the size of the maximum `int` and transmitted to the program by a `char` type string.

The program processes numbers up to 99999999999999999999999999999999999 inclusive.
